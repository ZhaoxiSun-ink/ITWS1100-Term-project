This is project was a lot of fun. Although it was difficut at times we got trhough it and made something that we are all proud of. 
Our biggest issue throughout this whole project was getting the API's to work for the regisiter and upload pages. We also had trouble
at times with the CSS, but we eventually got thoses. Overall, we thought that this project brought all of the skills we learned throughout
the semester into one and it was quite fun and enjoyable. (As a side note we are using an API called JSON server to get the regisiter page
working, but we could not get it to work properly for the uplaod page.)
